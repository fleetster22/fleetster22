## :mountain: Passions and Hobbies: :woman_farmer:

- First and foremost, I am a foster parent.
- Web App Development
- Hacking
- Ultrarunning
- Our small family farm eats up most of my free time. We have chickens, turkeys, alpaca and goats presently. 
- Travel


I am a junior Java software developer, interested in working for a company on an Agile team. There just aren't enough hours in the day to do everything I want. I wonder how long I can code on one burrito and a 20 oz Cherry Coke?

I'm looking to collaborate wth others who also want to learn, grow and improve their coding knowledge and skills. One day I hope to be a mentor to girls interested in coding.
