I am a software developer, primarily Python, with an interest in bbuilding apps and APIs for small business owners. There just aren't enough hours in the day to do everything I want. I am currently attending WGU pursuing a Bachelors degree in Software Development. 

I'm looking to collaborate wth others who also want to learn, grow and improve their coding knowledge and skills. One day I hope to be a mentor to girls interested in coding.

My wife and I just became licensed foster parents.
