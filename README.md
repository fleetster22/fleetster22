# 🌀 Anaka Norfleet 🌀



Computer professional with experience using Java, Javascript, React, Linux, Python, mySql and Github. My passion, however, lies in security, so if you're more focused on the creation of secure websites and apps or you need a junior level red teamer, then look no further. I am seeking a jr. penetration tester position with a company where the culture rewards continuing education and advancement from within because I do not plan on staying Jr level for very long. CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications. Currently focusing on learning intermediate Python and CTF competitions. My 5 year plan includes preparation for the OSCP certification and advancing to higher level penetartion testing positions.
