## :mountain: Passions and Hobbies: :woman_farmer:

 - Indie Game Dev
- Hacking
- Ultrarunning
- Our small family farm eats up most of my free time. We have chickens, turkeys, and goats presently. Hoping to have our field ready for a cow next spring.
- Travel


I am a software developer, primarily Java and a little C++, with a keen interest in indie game dev. There just aren't enough hours in the day to do everything I want. I am currently attending WGU pursuing a Bachelors degree in Software Development. 

I'm looking to collaborate wth others who also want to learn, grow and improve their coding knowledge and skills. One day I hope to be a mentor to girls interested in coding.

My wife and I are in training to become foster parents.
