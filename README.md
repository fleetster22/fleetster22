I am a junior Python programmer interested in working for a company as part of a team. I am most interested in Application and API Development. 
To gain more experience, I'm looking to contribute on open source projects. One day I hope to be a mentor to girls interested in STEM.

Random Thoughts: There just aren't enough hours in the day to do everything I want. I wonder how long I can code on one burrito and a 20 oz Cherry Coke?
