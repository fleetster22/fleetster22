## :mountain: Passions and Hobbies: :woman_farmer:

- Indie Game Dev
- Hacking
- Ultrarunning
- Our small family farm eats up most of my free time. We have chickens, turkeys, and goats presently. Hoping to have our field ready for a cow next spring.
- Travel


I am a software developer, primarily Python and Java, interested in working for a company on an Agile team. There just aren't enough hours in the day to do everything I want. When I'm coding, how can hours go by in what seems like seconds and the next thing you know I have greasy hair, fuzzy teeth and I'm starving? 

I'm looking to collaborate wth others who also want to learn, grow and improve their coding knowledge and skills. One day I hope to be a mentor to girls interested in coding.

The second half of this year, I am going to participate in more meetup goups. I need to surround myself with like-minded people.

My wife and I just became licensed foster parents and are looking forward to opening our home to youth in need.
