I am a software developer, primarily Java, as well as a website developer. I am attending WGU pursuing a Bachelors degree in Software Development. 

I'm looking to collaborate wth others who also want to learn, grow and improve their coding knowledge and skills. One day I hope to be a mentor to girls interested in coding.

My wife and I would love to become foster parents very soon.
